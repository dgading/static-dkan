An MSPB episode includes Medicare Part A and Part B payments for services provided by hospitals and other healthcare providers the 3 days prior to, during, and 30 days following a patient’s inpatient stay. This measure evaluates hospitals’ costs compared to the costs of the national median (or midpoint) hospital. This measure takes into account important factors like patient age and health status (risk adjustment) and geographic payment differences (payment-standardization).","title":"Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary – Hospital","programCode":["009:000"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/rrqw-56er/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"pqdc_0_0","format":"csv"}],"theme":[{"identifier":"hospitals","title":"Hospitals"}]}}}}
