Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, calculated by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack (AMI), heart failure (HF), pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hip/knee replacement (THA/TKA), and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients.","title":"Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program","programCode":["009:000"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.medicare.gov/api/views/9n3s-kdb3/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"pqdc_0_0","format":"csv"}],"theme":[{"identifier":"hospitals","title":"Hospitals"}]}}}}
